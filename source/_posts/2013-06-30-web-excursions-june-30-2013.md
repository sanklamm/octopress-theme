Brett Terpstra über seine Entscheidung sein Home Office zu einer gesundheitsfördernderen Umgebung umzubauen.

> I’ve spent years of my life sitting in front of computers, and there’s been a lot of talk recently about how that can cause health issues such as dying. Seems drastic, but I buy it. I’ve watched my health decline pretty steadily in the last 5 years. I also recently promised my wife that I’d try to live past 75 (I turn 35 in July, so there’s a ways to go). To that end, I wrote a script that undoes years of sedentary lifestyle, restores youth and vigor, and does one weird trick for a flat belly.

### [Brilliant End To Mad Men Season](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bastard-machine/brilliant-end-mad-men-season-574028)
> There’s no getting around it – great series answer the bell when called upon. In this sixth season, Mad Men has been scrutinized perhaps more negatively than ever before despite producing more good than bad episodes. But in the season finale, Mad Men stepped up with arguably its best episode of the season, a game-changer not only for the direction of the series but for its main focus, Don Draper.
